# REACT MOVIE WATCHLIST
I made this project using React. I used an API to fetch data regarding movies and extracted the information into my application. The app allows the user to search for any movie or show and then add it to their list. The user also has the ability to rate the movies prior to adding. I made this project to showcase my current React skills.
